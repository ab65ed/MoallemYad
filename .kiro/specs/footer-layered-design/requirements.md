# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a sophisticated footer design where Image 2 extends above the footer section with the highest display priority (z-index), while Image 3 occupies 90% of the footer height with a lower display priority positioned behind Image 2.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want Image 2 to extend above the footer section, so that it creates a visually appealing overlap effect with the previous section.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the footer is displayed THEN Image 2 SHALL extend partially above the footer section boundary
2. WHEN Image 2 overlaps with the previous section THEN it SHALL have the highest z-index priority for proper layering
3. WHEN the page is viewed THEN Image 2 SHALL maintain its extended height without affecting the layout of other elements
4. WHEN Image 2 is positioned THEN it SHALL create a seamless visual transition between sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want Image 3 to occupy most of the footer height while staying behind Image 2, so that both images create a layered visual composition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the footer is displayed THEN Image 3 and its container SHALL occupy exactly 90% of the footer height
2. WHEN Image 3 is positioned THEN it SHALL have a lower z-index than Image 2 to appear behind it
3. WHEN both images are displayed THEN Image 3 SHALL be positioned slightly below and behind Image 2
4. WHEN the footer layout is rendered THEN Image 3 SHALL maintain its proportional sizing within the 90% height constraint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the footer images to maintain proper layering and positioning across different screen sizes, so that the visual hierarchy remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the z-index layering between Image 2 and Image 3 SHALL remain consistent
2. WHEN viewed on different devices THEN Image 2 SHALL always maintain its extended height above the footer
3. WHEN the footer is displayed THEN Image 3 SHALL always occupy 90% of the footer height regardless of screen size
4. WHEN both images are visible THEN their relative positioning SHALL create a harmonious layered composition
