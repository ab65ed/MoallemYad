# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the responsiveness of footer images to ensure they properly adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining the main site width constraint of 1280px. The footer images should display optimally across all device types from large desktop screens down to mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the footer images to display properly within the main site width boundaries, so that the layout remains consistent with the overall site design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is 1280px or larger THEN the footer images SHALL be contained within a maximum width of 1280px
2. WHEN the viewport width is between 1024px and 1279px THEN the footer images SHALL scale proportionally to fit the available space
3. WHEN the footer is displayed THEN the images SHALL maintain their aspect ratio and visual quality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile device user, I want the footer images to be properly sized and positioned on smaller screens, so that I can view them clearly without horizontal scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is between 768px and 1023px THEN the footer images SHALL be optimized for tablet viewing
2. WHEN the viewport width is between 481px and 767px THEN the footer images SHALL be optimized for mobile viewing
3. WHEN the viewport width is 480px or smaller THEN the footer images SHALL be optimized for small mobile devices
4. WHEN viewed on any mobile device THEN the images SHALL NOT cause horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the footer images to maintain proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes, so that the visual hierarchy and design integrity are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the footer is displayed on any screen size THEN the images SHALL maintain proper spacing between each other
2. WHEN the viewport changes size THEN the images SHALL smoothly adapt their positioning and sizing
3. WHEN the footer images are displayed THEN they SHALL align properly with the bottom of the footer section
