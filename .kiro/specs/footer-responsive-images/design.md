# Design Document

## Overview

The footer responsive images feature will enhance the current footer implementation to ensure optimal display across all device sizes while maintaining the 1280px main width constraint. The design focuses on improving the CSS media queries and container constraints to provide better responsive behavior.

## Architecture

The footer follows a container-based responsive design pattern:

```
Footer Section (Full Width Background)
└── Footer Content Container (Max 1280px, Centered)
    ├── Left Footer Image
    └── Right Footer Image
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Footer Section Container
- **Purpose**: Provides full-width background while constraining content
- **Behavior**: Spans full viewport width with gradient background
- **Constraints**: No width limitations on the background

### Footer Content Container  
- **Purpose**: Contains and centers the footer images within the main site width
- **Behavior**: Centers content with max-width constraint and responsive padding
- **Constraints**: Maximum width of 1280px, responsive padding based on screen size

### Footer Images
- **Purpose**: Display decorative images at the bottom of the page
- **Behavior**: Responsive sizing with hover effects and proper alignment
- **Constraints**: Proportional scaling within container boundaries

## Data Models

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
- Extra Large: ≥1280px (Main site width)
- Large Desktop: 1024px - 1279px  
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Mobile: 481px - 767px
- Small Mobile: ≤480px
```

### Image Sizing Strategy
```css
- Desktop (≥1024px): Left 40%, Right 42% of container width
- Tablet (768-1023px): Left 42%, Right 44% of container width  
- Mobile (481-767px): Left 46%, Right 50% of container width
- Small Mobile (≤480px): Left 44%, Right 52% of container width
```

## Error Handling

### Image Loading
- Fallback alt text for accessibility
- Graceful degradation if images fail to load
- Maintain layout structure even without images

### Responsive Breakpoint Edge Cases
- Smooth transitions between breakpoints
- Prevent layout jumping during resize
- Handle edge cases at exact breakpoint values

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Test footer appearance at all defined breakpoints
- Verify image scaling and positioning
- Check hover effects and transitions

### Responsive Testing
- Test on actual devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify no horizontal scrolling occurs
- Check image quality at different sizes

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Test CSS media queries across browsers
- Verify flexbox behavior consistency
- Check gradient background rendering

### Performance Testing
- Ensure images load efficiently
- Verify smooth resize transitions
- Check hover effect performance
