# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update footer container CSS for improved 1280px width constraint
  - Modify `.footer-content` class to ensure proper centering and max-width behavior
  - Add explicit width constraints for the main site width of 1280px
  - Ensure proper margin and padding calculations for centering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Refine responsive breakpoints and image sizing
  - Update media queries to provide smoother transitions between breakpoints
  - Adjust image percentage widths for optimal display at each breakpoint
  - Ensure images maintain proper aspect ratios across all screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Improve mobile responsiveness and prevent horizontal scrolling
  - Optimize padding and margins for mobile devices
  - Ensure images never exceed container boundaries
  - Add safeguards to prevent horizontal scrolling on small screens
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Enhance image positioning and spacing consistency
  - Refine flexbox alignment properties for consistent spacing
  - Adjust image positioning to maintain proper visual hierarchy
  - Ensure smooth transitions when viewport size changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Optimize hover effects and visual feedback
  - Ensure hover effects work properly across all screen sizes
  - Maintain layout stability during hover interactions
  - Test and refine transition animations for smooth user experience
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Test responsive behavior across all breakpoints
  - Create test cases for each defined breakpoint
  - Verify image scaling and positioning at boundary values
  - Ensure no layout breaking occurs during resize operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_
